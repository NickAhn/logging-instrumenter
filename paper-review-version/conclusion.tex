\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we have proposed a tool, $\tool$, to instrument microservices-based applications that are deployed in Java Spring Framework for audit logging purposes. Our tool is based on an implementation model for concurrent systems that guarantees correctness of audit logging, using an information-algebraic semantic framework. $\tool$ receives the application source code, consisting of two or more microservices, along with a specification of audit logging requirements in JSON format. $\tool$ parses the JSON specification and extracts Horn clauses that are fed to a logic programming engine. $\tool$ instruments the microservices according to this specification. The instrumentation includes adding new repositories to the corresponding microservices, extending RESTful APIs on those microservices for logging-related communications, and weaving audit logging into the control flow of microservices using AspectJ. Our case study is a medical records system in which certain actions in authorization microservice may trigger logging events in access to patient medical data.
